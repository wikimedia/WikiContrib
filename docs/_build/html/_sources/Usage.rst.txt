Usage
=======

As specified, WikiContrib is used in visualizing the contributions of the wikimedians in the form of graphs and user contribution calendar. Let’s start the discussion with how to use the tool first.


Intro to Queries
================

A Query is initiated whenever a user searches for the contributions of a single or a group of wikimedians. A query has a lifetime of 30 days i.e the query expires in 30 days from the creation time. Each query is uniquely identified by a **64-bit** hash. Each query has a **group of filters** associated with it. There are three filters in a query:

1. Status of the commit.
2. From time.
3. Time Range.

**Status of the commit:** This is used in filtering the commits based on their status like **merged**, **Abandoned** etc. The user can even provide multiple statuses once. Suppose the user add “Merged” and “Open” to the status filter. It will search for the commits that are merged and open in both the platforms.

**From time:** The user can get all the commits from a specified time (i.e month and year).

**Time Range:** From the specified **From time**, the user needs to give a range of time to which he/she want to fetch the details (i.e last one year, last one month or last 6 months etc).


Query Creation
==============

To create a query, the user needs to add the data (username’s of Gerrit and Phabricator) to the query. The user can add the data in two different ways:

1. Entering username's manually.
2. Adding username's in bulk.


**Entering usernames manually:**


**Home page**

.. image:: ./home.png

Whenever the user goes to the home page, the above page will be displayed. In the above above, the table has three columns. They are:

1. Fullname
2. Gerrit Username
3. Phabricator Username.

The user needs to fill the above three details of the corresponding wikimedian whom the user wants to view the contributions of. ``Gerrit Username`` is used to fetch the data from **Gerrit APIs** and similarly, ``Phabricator Username`` is used for **Phabricator APIs**. The details fetched from both the APIs are associated with a common name i.e ``Fullname`` of the user. Fullname is also used in searching the users, we will discuss the searching later part of the doc.

There is an option provided to add usernames of multiple wikimedians. By clicking on **Button 2**, another empty row is added to the DOM. Similarly, the user can add any number of rows and fill the usernames into them. One of the cool things of the tool is the username’s, the user entered will be cached to the device. So, even if the user refresh the page or close the page, the details will not be lost! the user can fill a few username’s at some time, close the page and re-open it at some other time and add few other username’s. The user can also clear the cached data. Clicking the **Button 3** clears all the data he/she entered to the tool.

**Adding Username's in Bulk:**

Entering username’s of ten’s of users is easy. But what if the user wants to know the contributions of hundreds of **wikimedians**? It will take a lot of time and work to fill them manually to the tool. So, there is also an option to upload all the username’s in a CSV file. On clicking the toggle bar with text “Bulk Add”, the user will be provided with an option to upload a CSV file. If the user is uploading a CSV file, he/she need to fill the data in the file in a particular format.

The CSV format is:

.. image:: ./csv.png


**Once the data is provided,** (either entered manually or using a CSV file). The user can click the search button (i.e **Button 1**). This initiates a request to the server and starts making API requests to Gerrit and Phabricator. Once all the required details are fetched, it redirects to a URL ``/query_hash_code``. Now the user can see the graphs of user contributions vs time along with a calendar that displays the contributions.

**Note:** ``query_hash_code`` is the hash-code generated by the query, the query can be accessed at any point of time using the has code.

**User contribuion calendar looks like:**

.. image:: ./calendar.png

If the user click on a specific date in the above calendar, all the commits made by the wikimedian along with the ``platform`` and ``status of the commit`` will be displayed.

**Button 4** is the Info button, hovering it gives a popup with an intro paragraph about the tool.

Viewing / Updating filters
==========================

The user can view the results by following the above process of creating a query, there are also few filters displayed along with the result. The filters can be updated. Updating the current filters performs an API request and fetches the contributions of the wikimedian according to the filters the user provided.

There is also an option to reset the filters to the default ones. Filters are associated with the Query. The contributions of all the wikimedians are fetched according to the filters the user changed!

**Note:** Presently, the user can see all the contributions of any wikimedian for past one year (at maximum).

Viewing results
===============

Once the contributions of the user are fetched, there are these things displayed:
1. Graph of user contributions in **Gerrit**.
2. Graph of user contributions in **Phabricator**.
3. A simple calender that displays all the user contributions for the time span you provide (similar to **github**).

At a time, the contributions of a single user are displayed. There are arrows provided to get the details of the next and previous user to the current user.
There is also an input box provided. If you want to get the contributions of a specific user, you can search the ``fullname`` of the user in the search box.
It displays the recommendations of top 50 matching users.


Updating Quries
===============

Once a user creates a query with the username’s of a set of wikimedians and at a later point of time, if he/she wants to know the contributions of another wikimedian, instead of creating a new query for a single wikimedian, he/she can update the query and add the corresponding usernames.

There are four main different types of update's possible:

1. Initially a **CSV file** can be provided, another **CSV file** can be provided while updating the query.
2. Initially a **CSV file** can be provided, a set of **username’s of wikimedians** can be provided manually while updating the query.
3. Initially a **set of username’s** of wikimedians are provided manually, a **CSV file** can be provided while updating the query.
4. Initially a **set of username’s** of wikimedians are provided manually, another set of **username’s of wikimedians** are provided manually while updating the query.

Deleting Queries
================

Presently, the is no feature to delete a query. The query will be automatically deleted, after 30 days of its creation.
